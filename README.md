Reply to the email with your github account username (or create one and then reply) so I can invite you as collobrator (you have to accept it too). Create branches and PR requests if you want to edit the code. 

To actually use it, you have to 
1) Install VS Code if you don't have it
2) Install the latest Python
3) install ev3 extension
4) enter .venv environment with either py -3 -m venv .venv for Windows or python3 -m venv .venv for Mac
5) pip install pybricks-stubs
6) restart terminal

Everything should work after that, I think
